# Difference between this repo and the original react-redux-universal-hot-example

 - Make this project atomic, other demos that are not needed to initialize a new preject were removed.
 - Use [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) with redux.
 - Change api folder structure to be more like RESTful API design.
