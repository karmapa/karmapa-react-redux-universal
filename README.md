# Karmapa Universal Seed

 - This is a forked version of eikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example
 - For full instruction please refer to https://github.com/karmapa/karmapa-react-redux-universal

# Difference between this repo and the original react-redux-universal-hot-example

 - Make this project atomic, other demos that are not needed to initialize a new preject were removed.
 - Use [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to handle with reducers.
 - Change api folder structure to be more like RESTful API design.
